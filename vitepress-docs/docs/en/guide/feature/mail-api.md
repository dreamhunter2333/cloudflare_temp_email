# Mail API

## Mailbox Password Sessions

With both `ENABLE_ADDRESS_PASSWORD=true` and `ADDRESS_PASSWORD_LOGIN_ONLY=true`, password login, mailbox creation, and authorized user-center, admin, or Telegram access issue 30-day mailbox JWTs with `type: "address_password_login"`, `address`, `address_id`, `iat`, and `exp`. Mailbox APIs continue using `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` without a database migration.

- `GET /api/settings` returns mailbox identity, `send_balance`, and `new_address_token`. A valid password-login JWT with less than seven days remaining receives a new 30-day token; otherwise the field is `null`. Expired sessions must log in again; legacy credentials do not renew.
- The web client saves the renewed token and updates its local mailbox cache from one successful settings response, without making a second validation request. External clients should also save `new_address_token`.
- The local cache keeps its existing token-string format and decodes JWTs to display mailbox addresses and login methods. Credential-login and password-login entries remain separate, and renewal replaces matching entries in place. Decoding is used only for display and cache deduplication; authorization remains on the backend. Failed requests preserve the previous token and cache.
- Turning the switch off or disabling mailbox passwords restores legacy issuance for new logins and authorized access. Existing valid password sessions remain usable and renewable. Legacy credentials, `/open_api/credential_login`, credential login links, and direct API access remain accepted; the switch does not yet enforce legacy-credential rejection.
- Telegram retains its separate permanent internal binding tokens. Expiry is ignored only for stored historical bindings read after Telegram authentication; signature and mailbox identity checks remain required. New bindings must pass normal mailbox authentication.

Mailbox password changes continue using `POST /api/address_change_password`, without a User-tab reset form or an old-password requirement. Password changes do not revoke issued JWTs; valid sessions remain renewable.

## Viewing Emails via Mail API

This is a `python` example using the `requests` library to view emails.

```python
limit = 10
offset = 0
res = requests.get(
    f"https://<your-worker-address>/api/mails?limit={limit}&offset={offset}",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {your-JWT-password}",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)
```

**Note**: `/api/mails` returns raw RFC822 data by design (for example `source`/`raw`), and it does not guarantee parsed fields such as `subject`, `text`, or `html`. Parse the raw source on the client side (for example with `mail-parser-wasm` or `postal-mime`) if you need readable message content.

## Admin Mail API

Supports `address` filter

```python
import requests

url = "https://<your-worker-address>/admin/mails"

querystring = {
    "limit":"20",
    "offset":"0",
    # address is optional parameter
    "address":"xxxx@awsl.uk"
}

headers = {
        "x-admin-auth": "<your-Admin-password>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)

print(response.json())
```

**Note**: `/admin/mails` follows the same design as `/api/mails`: it returns stored raw MIME data. If you need readable subject/body, parse the raw content on the client side.

**Note**: Keyword filtering has been removed from the backend API. If you need to filter emails by content, please use the frontend filter input in the UI, which filters the currently displayed page.

## Mail Read Status API

Enable `ENABLE_MAIL_READ_STATUS` and upgrade the database first. Historical mail has `is_unread = NULL` and is treated as read; new mail has `is_unread = 1`. Opening unread mail from the web mail list marks it as read, and its detail view can switch the state manually. Refreshing the page does not mark it as read:

- `PATCH /api/mails/:id/read`: set one mail belonging to the current address; use `{ "isUnread": true }` for unread or `{ "isUnread": false }` for read

## Admin Get Mail API

Fetch a single mail by mail ID without a mailbox JWT. Authenticate with `x-admin-auth`.
The response matches one entry returned by `/admin/mails`: gzip-compressed raw content is decompressed into `raw`, and `raw_blob` is excluded.

```python
import requests

mail_id = 1
url = f"https://<your-worker-address>/admin/mails/{mail_id}"

headers = {
        "x-admin-auth": "<your-Admin-password>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

## Admin Delete Mail API

Delete a single mail by mail ID.

```python
import requests

mail_id = 1
url = f"https://<your-worker-address>/admin/mails/{mail_id}"

headers = {
        "x-admin-auth": "<your-Admin-password>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

## Admin Delete Address API

Delete an email address by address ID (also deletes associated mails, sender permissions, and user bindings).

```python
import requests

address_id = 1
url = f"https://<your-worker-address>/admin/delete_address/{address_id}"

headers = {
        "x-admin-auth": "<your-Admin-password>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

## Admin Clear Inbox API

Clear all received mails for an address by address ID.

```python
import requests

address_id = 1
url = f"https://<your-worker-address>/admin/clear_inbox/{address_id}"

headers = {
        "x-admin-auth": "<your-Admin-password>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

## Admin Clear Sent Items API

Clear all sent mails for an address by address ID.

```python
import requests

address_id = 1
url = f"https://<your-worker-address>/admin/clear_sent_items/{address_id}"

headers = {
        "x-admin-auth": "<your-Admin-password>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

## User Mail API

::: warning Note: User JWT vs Address JWT
This endpoint uses **User JWT** (obtained via `/user_api/login` or `/user_api/register`), with `x-user-token` header.

**Do not confuse with Address JWT**:
- Address JWT uses `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` to access `/api/*` endpoints
- User JWT uses `x-user-token: <jwt>` to access `/user_api/*` endpoints
:::

### Bound Address List

`GET /user_api/bind_address` uses server-side pagination and accepts these query parameters:

Requests without pagination parameters return the default first page. Fetching all bound addresses in one request is not supported.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | `20` | Page size, from 1 to 100 |
| `offset` | `0` | Pagination offset |
| `query` | Empty | Optional email address keyword filter for the current user's bound addresses; at most 100 characters, without `%` or `_` (invalid queries return 400) |

The `results` array contains only the current page. The filtered total is queried only when `offset=0`; later pages return `count: 0`, so clients should retain the total from the first page.

```python
import requests

url = "https://<your-worker-address>/user_api/bind_address"
headers = {
    "x-user-token": "<your-user-JWT-token>",
}
querystring = {
    "limit": "20",
    "offset": "0",
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
print(response.json())
```

### User Mail List

Supports `address` filter

```python
import requests

url = "https://<your-worker-address>/user_api/mails"

querystring = {
    "limit":"20",
    "offset":"0",
    # address is optional parameter
    "address":"xxxx@awsl.uk"
}

headers = {
        "x-user-token": "<your-user-JWT-token>",
        # "x-custom-auth": "<your-website-password>", # If private site password is enabled
    }

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)

print(response.json())
```

**Note**: `/user_api/mails` also returns raw RFC822 content from storage; parse it in your client to extract `subject`, `text`, and `html`.

**Note**: Keyword filtering has been removed from the backend API. If you need to filter emails by content, please use the frontend filter input in the UI, which filters the currently displayed page.
