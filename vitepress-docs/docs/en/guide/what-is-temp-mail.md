# Introduction to Temporary Email

## What is Temporary Email

A temporary email, also known as disposable email or temporary email address, is a virtual mailbox used for temporarily receiving emails. Unlike regular mailboxes, temporary emails are designed to provide an anonymous and temporary email receiving solution.

Temporary emails are often provided by websites or online service providers. Users can use temporary email addresses when they need to register or receive verification emails, without exposing their real email address. The benefit of this is to protect personal privacy.
